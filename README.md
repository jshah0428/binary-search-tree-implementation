# binary-search-tree-implementation

This program recursively makes a binary tree, recursively parses through it and implements different methods. It has three files which conduct the following tasks. 
- main.java - driver program that calls the functions in the BinarySearchTree.java and times how long it takes to output them.
- BinaryTree.java - abstract class that provides the outline of the methods implemented in the BinarySearchTree.java
- BinarySeartTree.java - implements 4 methods:
  - insert - inserts nodes into the BST
  - remove - removes nodes in the BST
  - search - searches for a node in the BST and outputs "found" or "not found" depending on its existence.
  - height - this counts how long the BST is(node-wise). _note: this method is not outlined in the abstract class in Binarytree.java_
